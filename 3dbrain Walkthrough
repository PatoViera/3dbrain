# This is a walkthrough on how to use the 3dbrain pipeline
# The purpose of this pipeline is to have a finalized ".stl" file which can be put into a 
# 3dprinter software (i.e. UltiMaker Cura) and print out a copy of the participant's brain. 

# In order to complete the pipeline a couple of other softwares need to be downloaded into a local computer 
# (either your own personal computer or one of the lab computers).
# The software needed are: 
#     - UltiMaker Cura: This is the 3D printer software that is needed to actually send the printing job to 
#        the 3D printer. The software can be downloaded here: https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/
#     - MeshLab: This software is used to simplify the 3D models of the brain so that they are suitable for
#        3D printing. The software can be downloaded here: https://www.meshlab.net/#download

# There are 2 main files that will be used in the pipeline.
#  - run_3dbrain_pipeline: This is the script that will actually run the pipeline to take a participant's 
#    T1 weighted image (T1w), then run the participants T1w through Freesurfer's recon-all process, convert the 
#    2 hemispheric ".pial" files (lh.pial, rh.pial) into 2 hemispheric ".stl" files (lh.stl, rh.stl), then we 
#    combine the 2 hemispheric ".stl" files into a single ".stl" (bh.stl) that represents the participants entire
#    cortical surface.
#    There should be no need to edit this file, however if there is an issue with the script please contact 
#    Patricio Viera Perez (pvier002@fiu.edu)
#  - submit_3dbrain_pipeline: This is the script that will be submitted to the SLURM scheduler. This script calls in the
#    "run_3dbrain_pipeline" script allowing it to run in parallel for each participant on the HPC. Thus we can run multiple
#    participants at a time, making the overall processing time shorter.

Step 1. Fork the 3dbrain repository on Github
          - Go to https://github.com/PatoViera/3dbrain and make a fork of the 3dbrain repository into your own account
Step 2. Log in to FIU's HPC.
          - Either through the visualization node (https://hpcgui.fiu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard) or through SSH
          - Make sure to use your FIU student username (ex. pvier002)
Step 3. Clone your forked Github repository into the HPC
          - In the command terminal navigate to a desired directory. For example, it can be your home directory ("home/[username]")
          or a project specific directory. 
          - You can use the command "cd" to change directories within the terminal. For example, typing "cd /home/[username]" into the
          comman terminal will take you to your home directory. Make sure to replace [username] with your FIU username
          - Once you are within your desired directory, in the command terminal type 
          "git clone git@github.com:[GitHub_username]/3dbrain.git" replacing [username] with your GitHub account username
          - You can check to see if the repositroy was cloned correctly if a new folder "3dbrain" was created within the desired directory, 
          navigating inside the "3dbrain" folder, then in the command terminal type "git status". It should say something like
          "# On branch master nothing to commit, working directory clean"
Step 4. Load up SLRUM module 
          - On the command terminal, type in "module load slurm" This should load up the SLURM module for your current session. This
          is what will allow you to submit the script "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" to the SLURM scheduler. 
Step 5. Prepare the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" script
          - Open the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" script either through a text editor like "Emacs Client" on the visualization node 
          or by typing "nano" on the command line.
          - You will need to specify a couple of things in this script based on the project that you are working on.
                    - #SBATCH -e /home/pvier002/3dbrain/err/%x_%A-%a_e.txt # Path to where the error files for the script 
                    (submit_3dbrain_pipeline) submission will be stored. - Typically this should be within a project specific folder
                    - #SBATCH -o /home/pvier002/3dbrain/out/%x_%A-%a_o.txt # Path to where the output files for the script 
                    (submit_3dbrain_pipeline) submission will be stored. - Typically this should be within a project specific folder 
                    - WORK_DIR="${SCRATCH_DIR}/pvier002/3dbrain" # Directory within the NBC lab scratch folder that stores all temporary files from
                    the 3dbrain pipeline. Change this to reflect your own scratch folder or a project specific scratch folder. 
                    - DATASET="${SCRATCH_DIR}/pvier002/3dbrain/dset" # Path to where the BIDS dataset is located - folder must include 
                    the "dataset_description.json file" - Does not have to be within the scratch folder
                    - OUT_DIR="${SCRATCH_DIR}/pvier002/3dbrain/derivatives/freesurfer-7.1" # Path to where the output of the pipeline processes
                    will be stored - typically a derivatives folder within a project specific directory - Does not have to be within the scratch folder
                    - CODE_DIR="/home/pvier002/3dbrain" # Path to where a copy of "run_3dbrain_pipeline.py" & "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" will 
                    be stored - Typically within the repository that you cloned in Step 3
                    - SUB_IDS="193 194" # List of participants that need to be run through the 3dbrain pipeline
          - Once you have edited the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" script to include the correct infromation for your project make sure
          that you you saved the changes to the script. 
                    - Nano: If you're in the nano text editor, typically:
                              - Press Ctrl + O to write the file (save).
                              - Press Enter to confirm the filename.
                              - Press Ctrl + X to exit nano.
                    - Vim: If you're in the vim text editor, typically:
                              - Press Esc to ensure you are in normal mode.
                              - Type :wq to write the file (save) and exit vim.
                    - Emacs: If you're in the emacs text editor, typically:
                              - Press Ctrl + X followed by Ctrl + S to save.
                              - Press Ctrl + X followed by Ctrl + C to exit Emacs.
Step 6. Submit the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" script
          - In the command terminal navigate into the directory where the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" is located by using the "cd"
          command. - Typically within the repository that you cloned in Step 3. (ex. cd /home/pvier002/3dbrain)
          - In the command terminal type "sbatch submit_3dbrain_pipeline"
          - You can check the status of the script by typing "squeue -u [username]" into the command terminal. The whole process 
          should take about ~3 hours to complete
          Make sure to replace [username] with your FIU username
          - You can also check out both the output and error files for each specific SLURM job submission to see the progess of 
          the pipeline or if there are any issues with the pipeline
          - You can check to see if the pipeline completed sucessfully by navigating to the output directory and opening the "full_stl"
          folder. Within that folder there should be a file named "sub-[subject-id]_combined.stl" (or files depending on how many participants 
          you ran through the pipeline at a time) with [subj-id] being the subject id that was specified in "submit_3dbrain_pipeline".
          - If the file(s) named "sub-[subject-id]_combined.stl" are missing then check the error files to see where there was an issue
          with the pipeline. 
Step 7. Download the combined ".stl" file(s)
          - Go to the HPCgui website (https://hpcgui.fiu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions), log-in using your FIU username
          - Navigate to the file transfer system by clicking on "Files" then clicking on the "Home Directory" that appears on the dropdown 
          menu. 
          - Click on the "Change directory" button near the top of the page and navigate to the directory where the combined ".stl" files are
          located.
          - Select the ".stl" file(s) that you want to download and click on the "Download" button near the top of the page. 
          - Download the selected ".stl" file(s) into a folder on the local computer.
Step 8. Open the ".stl" file(s) using MeshLab
          - Open the MeshLab software on the local computer
          - Import the "sub-[subject-id]_combined.stl" file by clicking "File" -> "Import Mesh". Navigate to where the ".stl" files are located
          and click "Open". Whatever message comes up, just click ok. - Make sure that the 3d model of the brain looks "normal" (i.e. it's one 
          solid model and not framented or broken)
          - Then click on "Filters" -> "Remeshing, Simplification, Reconstruction" -> "Simplification: Quadratic Edge Collapse Decimation". On 
          the new window enter "150000" under "Target number of faces". Then click "Apply". You can close the window by clicking "Close"
          - Then click on "Filters" -> "Smoothing, Fairing and Deformation'" -> "Laplacian Smooth" and just click "Apply" once. 
          You can close the window by clicking "Close".
          - Now export the brain by clicking "File" -> "Export Mesh As". Save the file as "sub-[subject-id]_combined_resamp_smooth.stl" in your 
          desired folder - Make sure that you change the "Save as type" to "STL File Format (*.stl)".

############################################################### Printing the 3D Brain ################################################################
Step 9. Prep the 3D printer software for printing
          - Open the UltiMaker Cura software on the local computer
          - Import the "sub-[subject-id]_combined_resamp_smooth.stl" file by clicking "File" -> "Open File(s)". Navigate to where the ".stl" files 
          are located in your local computer and select the desired ".stl" file and click "Open".
          - You will need to specify some parameters on UltiMaker Cura to ensure that the brain prints correctly
                    - Printer: You need to make sure that the 3D printer software knows what kind of printer you will be using. The printer that is used
                    in the NBC lab is the UltiMaker 3.
                              - Specify Ultimaker 3 as the printer of choice: Click on "Settings" -> "Printer" -> "Add Printer". A new window should appear 
                              with 2 options "UltiMaker printer" & "Non UltiMaker printer". Click on "UltiMaker printer" -> "Add local printer". There should
                              be 2 drop-down menus "Add a networked printer" & "Add a non-networked printer". Click on the "Add a non-networked printer" drop 
                              down menu and select "Ultimaker B.V." -> "Ultimaker 3". Then click "Add"
                    - Extruders: The 3D printer has 2 separate print cores that use different settings to print out different materials. Thus you need to 
                    adjust the settings for each individual extruder to be correct. 
                              - Set up the settings for Extruder 1: Click on "Settings" -> "Extruder 1" -> "Print core" -> "AA 0.4". 
                              Then click on "Settings" -> "Extruder 1" -> "Material" -> "Generic" -> "PLA".
                                        - PLA is the main filament that will be used to 3D print the participant's brain. 
                              - Set up the settings for Extruder 2: Click on "Settings" -> "Extruder 2" -> "Print core" -> "BB 0.8". 
                              Then click on "Settings" -> "Extruder 2" -> "Material" -> "Generic" -> "PVA".
                                        - PVA is a water soluble material that is used to print the support structures of the 3D printed brain.
                    - Brain Size: Select the participant's brain 3D model by just clicking anywhere on the model itself. On the left side of the window
                    click on the second option from the top "Scale". Make sure that the option "Uniform Scaling" is selected. This option will make sure
                    that any adjustment to the participant's brain size will adjust the other values accordingly to keep the same relative shape of the 
                    brain. 
                              - You can adjust the participant's brain size by changing any of the X, Y, or Z values or by changing any of the % scale values
                              - It is recommended to use a % scale value of 67% (X: 83.9695 mm, Y:113.2604 mm, Z:71.5977 mm)
                    - Print Settings: These settings are what determine the overall quality of the 3D brain and how fast the print job finishes. Click on 
                    "Profile" -> "Fast - 0.2 mm". This will set up most of the settings that you will need. However, to ensure the best possible quality
                    within reasonable time you will need to change some settings.
                              - These are the recommended print settings to change:
                                        - Initial Layer Height - 0.3 mm
                                        - Wall Extruder - Extruder 1 # This will also change the "Outer Wall Extruder" & "Inner Wall Extruder" settings. Do not
