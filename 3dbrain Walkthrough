#################################################### 3D Brain Pipeline ###########################################################################################################
# This file is inteded to be a comprehensive walkthrough on how to use the 3dbrain pipeline to generate 3D models of participants' brains from their T1-weighted image (T1w)

# There are several things that are needed before you can start running the pipeline
#     - BIDS dataset: Make sure that your participant's data is stored in BIDS format. The Brain Imaging Data Structure is a simple and intuitive way to organize and describe neuroimaging 
#     & behaviroal data. The pipeline expects the dataset to be in a BIDS format in order to search amd find all of the relevant files. 
#          - More information about BIDS and how to ensure that your dataset is in BIDS format can be found here (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/index.html)
#     - run_3dbrain_pipeline: This is the script that will actually run the pipeline to take a participant's 
#     T1 weighted image (T1w), then run the participant's T1w through Freesurfer's recon-all process, convert the 
#     2 hemispheric ".pial" files (lh.pial, rh.pial) into 2 hemispheric ".stl" files (lh.stl, rh.stl), then
#     combine the 2 hemispheric ".stl" files into a single ".stl" (bh.stl) that represents the participant's entire
#     cortical surface.
#     - submit_3dbrain_pipeline: This is the script that will be submitted to the SLURM scheduler on FIU's HPC. This script calls in the
#     "run_3dbrain_pipeline" script allowing it to run in parallel for each participant on FIU's HPC. Thus you can run multiple
#     participants at a time, making the overall processing time shorter.

# In order to complete the pipeline a couple of softwares need to be downloaded into a local computer.
# The softwares needed are: 
#     - UltiMaker Cura: This is a 3D printer software that is needed to set up the printing job that can then be saved and  
#     put directly into the 3D printer. The software can be downloaded here: https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/
#     - MeshLab: This software is used to simplify the 3D models of the brain so that they are suitable for
#     3D printing. The software can be downloaded here: https://www.meshlab.net/#download

Step 1. Download the necessary scripts & software
          - To download the necessary scripts go to "https://github.com/fiuneuro/3dbrain" and download both the "run_3dbrain_pipeline" & 
          "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" scripts - Click on each script and press the "Download Raw File". Save the script to a desired folder or directory.
          - UltiMaker Cura - The software can be downloaded here: https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/
          - MeshLab - The software can be downloaded here: https://www.meshlab.net/#download
Step 2. Log in to FIU's HPC.
          - If you are not connecting from a secure campus network, you will need to be connected to the FIU network via the FIU VPN in order to access the HPC. 
                    - For more details, see https://network.fiu.edu/vpn/.
          - Users typically access FIU's HPC via command-line interface. This requires a UNIX-like terminal (such as the Terminal app included with MacOS) or 
          a secure shell client (such as PuTTY or Ubuntu in Windows).
                    - To log in to hpclogin01 from a UNIX-like terminal, input the following command, where “username” is your FIU username, enter the following in terminal:
                              - $ ssh username@hpclogin01.fiu.edu
          - Users can also access FIU's HPC by connecting to an encrypted web portal using a web browser to initiate a remote desktop session. This option provides users the 
          necessary tools to visualize graphical content on the HPC.
                    - Login at the FIU Panther cluster Web portal from any modern and upto date web browser: https://hpcgui.fiu.edu - Log in using your FIU credentials
                    - After a successful login click the “Intereactive Apps” tab on the Navigation Bar at the top of the window.
                    - Click a “Panther Desktop” icon - A new page should appear prompting the "Number of Hours" for a session
                    - Click on Drop down Menu on “Number of hours” or manually enter the number of hours you want your interactive session to last. - The maximum number of hours allowed is 10
                    - Then click “Launch” icon - After a few moments the new session should start
                    - In the new session window you can adjust the compression and image quality for your session as per your desire 
                    - Click the "Launch Panther Desktop" icon
                    - You will now be redirected in to a desktop view. Use the desktop session to navigate your files, open them in text editer and copy files between your folders.
Step 3. Transfer the necessary scripts into FIU's HPC
          - It is recommended that you create a new project specific folder (e.g. /home/pvier002/3dbrain) and upload the files into that folder.
          - Using the FIU Panther cluster Web portal you can navigate your files from the “Files” -> "Home Directory" tab at the top of the window. 
                    - Navigate to your desired folder and click on the "Upload" button near the top of the window. 
          - File transfer to the cluster can be accomplished via a secure copy client, such as WinSCP in Windows (https://winscp.net/eng/index.php), or via the secure copy (scp) command in a UNIX-like terminal. 
                    - To copy a file from your local disk to your home directory on the cluster using a UNIX terminal, issue the following command:
                              - $ scp path_to_file username@hpclogin01.fiu.edu:~
           
Step 4. Load the Slurm module in your session
          - In order to efficiently balance the load from all of our users, the HPC utilizes a resource management system called Slurm. Slurm is a highly configurable workload manager
          commonly used in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. (Full documentation for slurm is available here: https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html). It efficiently
          manages and schedules jobs and tasks across a cluster of computers, helping users and administrators allocate and utilize computing resources effectively. Slurm provides a
          command-line interface and robust job scheduling capabilities, making it an essential tool for managing large-scale computational workloads.
                    - You can load the Slurm module by running the follwoing command on the login node:
                              - $ module load slurm
          - Here is a reference sheet for possible commands on the Slurm module (https://ircc.fiu.edu/download/user-guides/Slurm_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
Step 5. Prepare the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" script
          - Open the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" script either through a text editor like "Emacs Client" on the visualization node 
          or by typing "nano" or "vim" on the command line.
          - You will need to change several things in the script based on the project that you are working on.
                    - Create an "err" folder somewhere. Typically this should be within a project specific folder
                    - The error files for the script (submit_3dbrain_pipeline) submission will be stored in that "err" folder.
                             - #SBATCH -e /home/pvier002/3dbrain/err/%x_%A-%a_e.txt # Change this path to reflect where the "err" folder is located that you created.  
                              
                    - #SBATCH -o /home/pvier002/3dbrain/out/%x_%A-%a_o.txt # Path to where the output files for the script 
                    (submit_3dbrain_pipeline) submission will be stored. - Typically this should be within a project specific folder 
                    - source activate /home/data/nbc/tools/3dbrain/env # Path to a Python3 environment within FIU's HPC.
                              - A guide on how to make custom Python environemnts inside FIU's HPC can be found here (https://ircc.fiu.edu/custom-environments-and-package-installation-r-and-python/)
                              - Packages needed for this pipeline:
                                        1. Nypipe
                                        2. Pybids
                                        3. argparse
                              - If the environemt is missing a certain package you can install it by typing the following command:
                                        - $ pip install [package] (e.g. $ pip install nypipe)
                    - SCRATCH_DIR="/scratch/nbc" # Path to a lab/project scratch folder
                    - WORK_DIR="/home/pvier002/3dbrain" #  Path to a working directory where the temporary files made by the pipelie will be stored. - Typically within a scratch directory 
                              - Participant data should only be moved into the scratch filesystem for processing. 
                    - DATASET="/home/pvier002/3dbrain/dset" # Path to where the BIDS dataset is located - folder must include the "dataset_description.json file"
                    - OUT_DIR="home/pvier002/3dbrain/derivatives/freesurfer-7.1" # Path to where the output of the pipeline processes will be stored 
                              - Typically a derivatives folder within a project specific directory
                    - CODE_DIR="/home/pvier002/3dbrain" # Path to where a copy of "run_3dbrain_pipeline.py" & "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" will be stored
                    - SUB_IDS="193 194" # List of participants that need to be run through the 3dbrain pipeline
          - Once you have edited the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" script to include the correct information for your project make sure
          that you you saved the changes to the script. 
                    - Nano: If you're in the nano text editor, typically:
                              - Press Ctrl + O to write the file (save).
                              - Press Enter to confirm the filename.
                              - Press Ctrl + X to exit nano.
                    - Vim: If you're in the vim text editor, typically:
                              - Press Esc to ensure you are in normal mode.
                              - Type :wq to write the file (save) and exit vim.
                    - Emacs: If you're in the emacs text editor, typically:
                              - Press Ctrl + X followed by Ctrl + S to save.
                              - Press Ctrl + X followed by Ctrl + C to exit Emacs.
Step 6. Submit the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" script
          - In the command terminal navigate into the directory where the "submit_3dbrain_pipeline" is located by using the "cd"
          command. 
                    - e.g. $ cd /home/pvier002/3dbrain
          -  To submit a job for execution on the cluster, use the sbatch command followed by the name of your submission script. 
                    - For example:
                              - $ sbatch submit_3dbrain_pipeline.txt
          - To monitor the status of your submitted jobs, utilize the squeue command with the --me flag
                    - This will display information about your jobs only: 
                              - $ squeue –-me
          - The whole process should take about ~3 hours to complete
          - You can also check out both the output and error files for each specific Slurm job submission to see the progess of the pipeline or if there are any issues with the pipeline
          - You can check to see if the pipeline completed sucessfully by navigating to the output directory and opening the "full_stl" folder. Within that folder there should be a file 
          named "sub-[subject-id]_combined.stl" (or files depending on how many participants you ran through the pipeline at a time) with [subj-id] being the subject id that was specified in "submit_3dbrain_pipeline".
          - If the file(s) named "sub-[subject-id]_combined.stl" are missing then check the error files to see where there was an issue with the pipeline. 
Step 7. Download the combined ".stl" file(s)
          - Go to the HPCgui website (https://hpcgui.fiu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions), log-in using your FIU username
          - Navigate to the file transfer system by clicking on "Files" then clicking on the "Home Directory" that appears on the dropdown menu. 
          - Click on the "Change directory" button near the top of the page and navigate to the directory where the combined ".stl" files are located.
          - Select the ".stl" file(s) that you want to download and click on the "Download" button near the top of the page. 
          - Download the selected ".stl" file(s) into a folder on the local computer.
Step 8. Open the ".stl" file(s) using MeshLab
          - Open the MeshLab software on the local computer
          - Import the "sub-[subject-id]_combined.stl" file by clicking "File" -> "Import Mesh". Navigate to where the ".stl" files are located and click "Open". 
          Whatever message comes up, just click ok. - Make sure that the 3d model of the brain looks "normal" (i.e. it's one solid model and not framented or broken)
          - Then click on "Filters" -> "Remeshing, Simplification, Reconstruction" -> "Simplification: Quadratic Edge Collapse Decimation". On 
          the new window enter "150000" under "Target number of faces". Then click "Apply". You can close the window by clicking "Close"
          - Then click on "Filters" -> "Smoothing, Fairing and Deformation'" -> "Laplacian Smooth" and just click "Apply" once. 
          You can close the window by clicking "Close".
          - Now export the brain by clicking "File" -> "Export Mesh As". Save the file as "sub-[subject-id]_combined_resamp_smooth.stl" in your 
          desired folder - Make sure that you change the "Save as type" to "STL File Format (*.stl)".

############################################################### Printing the 3D Brain ################################################################
Step 9. Prep the 3D printer software for printing the participant's brain
          - Open the UltiMaker Cura software on the local computer
          - Import the "sub-[subject-id]_combined_resamp_smooth.stl" file by clicking "File" -> "Open File(s)". Navigate to where the ".stl" files 
          are located in your local computer and select the desired ".stl" file and click "Open".
          - You will need to specify some parameters on UltiMaker Cura to ensure that the brain prints correctly
                    - Printer: You need to make sure that the 3D printer software knows what kind of printer you will be using. 
                              -For this example, the printer that is used in the NBC lab is the UltiMaker 3.
                              - Specify Ultimaker 3 as the printer of choice: Click on "Settings" -> "Printer" -> "Add Printer". A new window should appear 
                              with 2 options "UltiMaker printer" & "Non UltiMaker printer". Click on "UltiMaker printer" -> "Add local printer". There should
                              be 2 drop-down menus "Add a networked printer" & "Add a non-networked printer". Click on the "Add a non-networked printer" drop 
                              down menu and select "Ultimaker B.V." -> "Ultimaker 3". Then click "Add"

                    - Extruders: In this example it is assumed that the prineter has 2 separate print cores that use different settings to print out different materials. 
                    Thus settings need to be adjusted for each individual extruder. 
                              - Set up the settings for Extruder 1: Click on "Settings" -> "Extruder 1" -> "Print core" -> "AA 0.4". 
                              Then click on "Settings" -> "Extruder 1" -> "Material" -> "Generic" -> "PLA".
                                        - PLA is the main filament that will be used to 3D print the participant's brain. 
                              - Set up the settings for Extruder 2: Click on "Settings" -> "Extruder 2" -> "Print core" -> "BB 0.8". 
                              Then click on "Settings" -> "Extruder 2" -> "Material" -> "Generic" -> "PVA".
                                        - PVA is a water soluble material that is used to print the support structures of the 3D printed brain.

                    - Brain Location: Select the participant's brain 3D model by just clicking anywhere on the model itself. On the left side of the window
                    click on the first option from the top "Move". Make sure that the option "Drop Down Model" is un-selected. This will allow you to adjust the height of the 3D model
                    without issues. 
                              - You can adjust the location of the participant's brain by changing any of the X, Y, or Z values. 
                                        - In order for the supports for the brain to be printed correctly you need to lift the brain by at least 5 mm (X: 0 mm, Y: 0 mm, Z: 5 mm)                    

                    - Brain Size: Select the participant's brain 3D model by just clicking anywhere on the model itself. On the left side of the window
                    click on the second option from the top "Scale". Make sure that the option "Uniform Scaling" is selected. This option will make sure
                    that any adjustment to the participant's brain size will adjust the other values accordingly to keep the same relative shape of the 
                    brain. 
                              - You can adjust the participant's brain size by changing any of the X, Y, or Z values or by changing any of the % scale values
                                        - It is recommended to use a % scale value of 30% (X: 51.0027 mm, Y:37.5136 mm, Z:30.9482 mm)
          
                    - Print Settings: These settings are what determine the overall quality of the 3D brain and how fast the print job finishes. Click on 
                    "Profile" -> "Fast - 0.2 mm". This will set up most of the settings that you will need. However, to ensure the best possible quality
                    within reasonable time you will need to change some settings.
                    - In order ot be able to change all the necessary print settings you will need to change the setting visibility. Click "Settings" -> "Configure setting visibility". 
                    A new window should appear. Click on the drop down menu on the right side of the window and select "All". Then close the window.
                              - These are the recommended print settings to change:
                                        - Wall Extruder - Extruder 1 # This will also change the "Outer Wall Extruder" & "Inner Wall Extruder" settings. Do not
                                        change the settings further
                                        - Wall Thickness - 0.8 # This will also change the "Wall Line Count" setting. Do not change the setting further
                                        - Wall Ordering - Inside to Outside
                                        - Z Seam Alignment - Sharpest Corner
                                        - Seam Corner Preference - Smart Hiding
                                        - Top Surface Skin Extruder - Extruder 1
                                        - Top Surface Skin Layers - 1

                                        - Brim Replaces Support - The box should be checked
                                        - Enable Prime Tower - The box should be checked

          - Once you have specified the necessary parameters and print settings click on the "Preview" tab near the top of the window.The participant's brain should turn grey
          and semi translucent. 
          - Then click the "Slice" button near the bottom right of the window. It should take a couple of minutes for the slicing process to finish. You can hit the "Cancel" button 
          at any point to cancel the slicing process if necessary. 
          - When the slicing process is done you can scrub the bar up and down on the right side of the window to review the printing process per slice. Near the bottom right of 
          the window the program will then tell you the total time that it will take to finish printing the participant's brain. 
                    - It should take around 3 hours and 22 minutes based on the recommended parameters
                    - The total printing time could take longer or less depending on different specified factors such as size and quality 
Step 10. Save the 3D printer settings to external USB hardrive
          - Please review all of the settings and do a visual review of how the 3D software is going to print the participant's brain. If everything looks good, then you can click 
          the "Save to Disk" button near the bottom right of the window. 
          - Save the 3D print file to an external USB flashdrive. Make sure that you save the print file under a distinct name, for example "[project_name]_[participant_id]_3dbrain.gcode".
Step 11. Prep the 3D printer for printing the participant's brain
          - A video guide on how to set up the Ultimaker 3 printer properly (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBXS_u9q5Fo&ab_channel=AdvancedGeekery)
          - Reference your 3D printer user manual on how to specify the printer's extruders correctly. 
                    - The first extruder should be set to AA 0.4
                    - The first extruder should be set to BB 0.8
          - Make sure that the correct filaments are loaded on the 3D printer for each extruder. 
                    - The PLA filament of your desired color should be loaded onto the first extruder
                    - The PVA filament should be loaded into the second extruder
Step 12. Print the participant's brain
          - In an Ultimaker 3 printer, simply insert the USB flashdrive in the front part of the printer. 
          - Navigate the printer's menu to the "Print" section
          - It should give you an option to print any supported file on the USB flashdrive.
          - Select the participant's 3dbrain ".gcode" file, (e.g. [project_name]_[participant_id]_3dbrain.gcode) and select "Confirm"
          - The 3D printer should begin to print the participant's brain.
          - You can cancel the print at any point by selecting "Tune" -> "Abort this print" 
Step 13. Finishing the print
          - Once the print is done, carefully remove the print including the supports from the build plate. 
          - Since this pipeline uses PVA, a water soluble material, for the support structures then you can simply submerge the print in hot water to disolve the structures. 
          - Visually examine the participant's 3D brain for any issues or mistakes. You can use a fine grade sand paper or a small precision knife to remove any undesired imperfections
          left on the print. 
          - The participant's 3D brian is now ready to be presented.
